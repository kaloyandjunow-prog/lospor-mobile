/**
 * Reaching the case screen from postop is the clinician's deliberate "I'm
 * done" action and is what should start the closure countdown, not whichever
 * autosave happened to complete the last field. The server re-runs the same
 * completeness check finalize() applies, so a refusal is a clinical answer --
 * an incomplete preoperative assessment, no intraoperative record -- and not a
 * technicality.
 *
 * It used to be fire-and-forget, on the reasoning that the case screen reads
 * the case fresh from the server anyway. That is true of the *status*, and not
 * of anything the clinician would notice: nothing on that screen says "no
 * countdown is running", so a case still IN_PROGRESS looked exactly like one
 * submitted. `apiFetch` also resolves on a 4xx, so the empty catch here was
 * only ever catching the network, and every refusal passed through as success.
