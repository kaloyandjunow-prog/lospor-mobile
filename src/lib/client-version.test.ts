/**
 * Three places state this app's version, and nothing kept them together.
 *
 * They had drifted three ways at once — package.json at 9.7.5, app.json at
 * 9.3.1, and the client constant at 8.0.0 — so the About screen named a version
 * four releases old, and a support report, the one artifact whose entire job is
 * to say what was running, named two different wrong ones.
 *
 * A release bumps package.json. Nothing made the others follow, and nothing
 * complained, because a stale version string breaks nothing on the day it goes
 * stale. This is what complains.
