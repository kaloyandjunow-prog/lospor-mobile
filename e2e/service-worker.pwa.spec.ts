/**
 * The served service worker must be able to retire what it has cached.
 *
 * This exists because it could not. The cache names were a hand-written "v4"
 * that no release had ever changed, bundles were served cache-first and never
 * revalidated, and anything with an ok status was stored. One interrupted
 * download put a truncated bundle in a phone's cache under the exact filename
 * the app asks for, and that phone then failed to parse it on every visit
 * afterwards — no splash, no error, a black screen — while the same build
 * loaded correctly for everyone else and in a private window.
 *
 * Nothing could reach that phone. Every later release served the same cache
 * names, so nothing retired the entry, and the storage it sat in is not cleared
 * by clearing cookies. The build id below is what makes a deploy able to fix a
 * device it has already broken.
