// Joining and leaving a department, from the phone.
//
// The rules are the server's and the web suite pins them there. What only this
// suite can show is that the phone's settings screen drives them correctly:
// that "Leave" actually leaves rather than filing a request nobody will answer,
// that it disappears once there is nothing left to leave, and that choosing a
// hospital files a request and says so instead of relabelling itself as though
// the move had already happened — which is what it used to do.
//
// member-b does the moving. A failed run can leave them unaffiliated; the
// seeder in lospor-api puts the cast back.
