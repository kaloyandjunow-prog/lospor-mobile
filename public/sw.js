// LOSPOR clinical PWA service worker
// Strategy:
//   - App shell (index.html): cache on install, serve from cache as offline fallback
//   - Static JS/CSS/fonts (/_expo/static/*, /assets/*): cache-first after first fetch
//   - API calls (/api/*): always network-only — clinical data must be live
//
// The cache names carry the build id, stamped in by scripts/patch-pwa.mjs, so a
// deploy retires the previous caches through the activate handler below.
//
// They used to be a hand-written "v4" that no release had ever changed, and the
// combination was a trap with no way out: a bundle is served cache-first and
// never revalidated, anything with an ok status is stored, and nothing ever
// retires an entry. One interrupted download — a phone leaving a lift, a hotspot
// dropping mid-fetch — puts a truncated bundle in the cache under the filename
// the app asks for, and the device then fails to parse it on every visit
// afterwards. That failure shows nothing: no splash, no error, a black screen,
// and it survives clearing cookies because Cache Storage is not cookies.

/**
 * Serve a hashed asset from the cache, and store it only once it has arrived
 * whole.
 *
 * The entry written here is the one every later visit is served without asking
 * the network again, so writing a partial one is not a slow load, it is a
 * device that never works again. Two things make that easy to do by accident:
 *
 * respondWith keeps this worker alive only until the response is *returned*,
 * which happens when the headers arrive and not when the body finishes. A
 * cache write started after that point is unprotected, and closing the tab
 * while a bundle is still downloading kills the worker in the middle of it.
 * That is a real report, not a theory: leave during the splash and the app is
 * broken on every visit afterwards. So the write is held open with waitUntil.
 *
 * And a truncated body is still a 200 with an ordinary type, so nothing about
 * the response says it is short. The only honest check is to read it to the end
 * and weigh it against the length the server declared.
